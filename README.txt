Project Name: AWS Satellite Data Processing Pipeline

Description:
This project sets up an automated pipeline to run a Python script in AWS Lambda which processes satellite data. The processed data is then sent to an AWS Kinesis Data Stream. This stream is monitored by AWS CloudWatch for logging and potential further processing or monitoring actions.

Requirements:
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, S3 buckets, IAM roles, policies, Kinesis streams, and CloudWatch logs.
- Terraform installed on the local development machine.
- Python 3.x installed on the local development machine, if intending to run the Lambda function locally.
- An environment file (.env) with necessary AWS credentials and configuration settings.

Replication across different environments:
1. Clone the project repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure AWS credentials are configured either via environment variables or AWS CLI.
3. Navigate to the project directory where the Terraform configuration files are located.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project and download the required providers.
5. Run `terraform plan` to review the actions Terraform will perform.
6. Execute `terraform apply` to create the resources in AWS.
7. If changes are made to the infrastructure, re-run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

Important:
- The Lambda function's source code (main.py) and any dependencies should be zipped and placed in the root directory with the name `satellite.zip`.
- The `.env` file should never be checked into version control and should contain environment-specific variables.

Versioning:
- Use Git for version control. Ensure that `.gitignore` is configured to ignore files that shouldn't be version-controlled (e.g., local state files, sensitive variable files).

Logs and Monitoring:
- AWS CloudWatch is set up to capture logs from the Lambda function. Kinesis streams these logs for real-time processing and monitoring.
- To view logs or metrics, navigate to the AWS CloudWatch console.

Additional Notes:
- The infrastructure is codified using Terraform, which allows for version-controlled, repeatable, and automated setup.
- When updating the Lambda function's code, remember to update the ZIP file and re-run Terraform to deploy the changes.
- Adjust the retention policies and monitoring metrics according to your specific use case and compliance requirements.
